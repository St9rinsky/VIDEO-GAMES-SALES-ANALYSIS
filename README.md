## SUMMARY
This dashboard provides sales summary of gaming sales from 1970 to 2022. The data was obtained from Kaggle and features over 50 000 records that include data on game titles, Consoles, publishers and sales from four major regions. The data was was cleaned, normalised, analysed and visualised in this project.

## The dashboard answers the following business questions and more 

1. **Sales trends**
   * How have sales evolved over time?
   * What are the regional sales trends by year?
   * Which months have the highest sales?

2. **Regional Sales**
   * What are the total sales across all regions?
   * How do sales break down by region?
     
3. **Top selling consoles,publishers and genres**
   * How do sales compare across Consoles?
   * Which publishers dominate the market?
   * Which game genres generate the most sales?

## I took the following steps to create the dashboard
1. Downloaded Raw .csv data from kaggle.
2. Quickly analysed the raw data for inconsistencies.
3. Imported the raw data into Pycharm.
4. Cleaned and Normalised the data by removing uneccesary columns and filled missing values using Pandas extention.
5. Imported the clean data into Ms SQL for Exploratory Data analysis.
6. Imported the data into Power BI.
7. Created Visualisations on Power BI using some of the insights found during the SQL EDA.
8. Published everything on Github.

## key Insight
1. North America dominates video games sales with over 50% of global sales contributions and with Japan the least dominant with less than 10% of the total global contribution'
2. sports, shooter and role-playing genres dominate the sales whilst simulation and adventure games being the least dominant
3. Sales are higher in December suggesting a strong link with holiday seasons

## Recommendations
1. Marketing efforts should focus on North America and Europe regions since the contribute over 80% of the global sales
2. Launch major titles during holiday seasons to maximise on sales.
3. Invest in development of shooter and sports games because they generate the most sales.
